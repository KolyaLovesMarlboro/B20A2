    <!--index.html serves no purpose in the assignment, user will never see this page
    
      I have 1 JS and 1 CSS file for all the html pages as they are pretty similar and neither CSS, Nor JS took a lot of space
      to use interfaces or implement design patters, as everything fit in one file at the same time staying readable. 


      The HTML structure is pretty easy too, however big amount of pages causes major amount of inattentive mistakes.
      But average use case for this web site looks like this:

      User starts at the home page and reads short descriptions. One of the books caught their eye so they decide to 
      read about the book in more detail. They liked the book and decide to write a review for it, they clicked the button 
      "leave review", they rated the book and thanked the author for helping them to find the new book.


      For admin: can do everything same as user, but main use case is to rearrange the TOP 5 books. In the future
      it would be a good idea to count avg rating of each book and rearrange their position based on that.
